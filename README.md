# UFOs
Bootcamp Module 11

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create a dynamic webpage to filter the results of UFO sightings. In the webpage we can find a header where we can see the subject of the page. We can also find a paragrah debating several facts of UFO appearances. And finally, we have a dynamic table, where we can filter the data by date, country, state, city and shape. We can filter several fields at once to look for a specific event.

## Results
The webpage is very dynamic and easy to use. As we can see in the image, we have our search boxes. In these boxes, we can type the keywords. If we don't type anything, we can see the full table. We can filter one, two, three or even all five boxes to find the desired results.

### Date
We can filter by date. We just type the date a certain UFO Sighting happened. For example we are going to type 1/2/2010 in the "Date" search box:
<img width="1422" alt="Captura de Pantalla 2021-09-05 a la(s) 20 36 02" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85461477/132148624-b5ddcbbf-d04b-4709-af35-e6542ea03ee3.png">

As we can see we have 8 sightings that day, in several different states, all in the US.

### Country
We can also filter the data by country where the event happened, which can be very useful if we want to search a non-US sighting. We are going to look for all the Canadian sightings from our data. We are going to type "ca" for Canada in the box:
<img width="1440" alt="Captura de Pantalla 2021-09-05 a la(s) 20 40 16" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85461477/132149012-e2ec7e84-dd04-4116-a44c-57fbb7162b8e.png">

As we can see, we have 2 sightings in Canada, one from London, Ontario in 1/9/2010, and another one in Ingleside, Ontario on 1/11/2010.

### State
We can also filter by state. We are going to type "ca" for California in the box. This way, we are going to get all the California UFO sightings.
<img width="1440" alt="Captura de Pantalla 2021-09-05 a la(s) 20 46 29" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85461477/132149235-4e4f0a69-6d10-46f7-84fc-ed25eefdb620.png">

As we can see, we have several sightings in California.

### City
We have the option to filter by city. As we can see, we have a lot of results for California, so we if we want a more specific result, we can search for a city. For example we can filter "san diego" in the city box.
<img width="1440" alt="Captura de Pantalla 2021-09-05 a la(s) 20 50 55" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85461477/132149565-02c10b63-649d-45e5-a4b2-f17a870ef508.png">

As we can see, we have 3 sightings in the city of San Diego.

### Shape
The last option in our webpage is by shape. We have several different shapes of UFO Sightings. We're going to search for "sphere", so we can have all the sphere results from the data in our webpage.
<img width="1439" alt="Captura de Pantalla 2021-09-05 a la(s) 20 53 11" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85461477/132149712-8135cb01-c8c7-460d-b1fc-c42de44240b0.png">

We can observe, it is also a frequent shape from our data, with 11 results from our search.

### Multiple filters
As we saw earlier, we have multiple sightings in the 1/1/2010. We can also see most sightings are in the US. Several sightings happened in California. 3 happened in San Diego. Also, many sightings had sphere shape. So we are goin to filter all the criteria to get the specific results with those characteristics:
<img width="1436" alt="Captura de Pantalla 2021-09-05 a la(s) 20 58 28" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85461477/132150127-e76d3cfe-5c01-46dd-9db2-770ad51fd0f3.png">

We have one results that matches all the filters. This way the user can use our webpage to find the desired UFO sighting.


## Summary
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

The main drawback of our webpage is the date search. The search woul be be more intuitive if we could filter by range of dates. If there was no UFO event on a certain date, we get a blank table, however if we searched for a range of dates, we could see the events close to that date, which could be helpful for the users.

#### Recommendations
My recommendations for improving the webpage are the following:
- We could use dropdown menus to see the options. This way we could see the different countries, shapes, etc. before the search, so we could be more time efficient.
- I would also add a link to find references for the sighting in the data table. This would help UFO enthusiast with their search so they could find the events in our webpage, then click the link with the reference to research facts of the sighting.
